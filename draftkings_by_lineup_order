###For 90th percentile games, what is the distribution of DK points by lineup position?
#Is it as top heavy as we would assume or
#is it a little flatter and give more credence to stacks with guys lower in the batting order?

#create game ids in batter games and team games data frames
batter_games$game_id <- paste(batter_games$Team, batter_games$Date)
team_games$game_id <- paste(team_games$Team, team_games$Date)

#get list of game ids for 90+ percentile DK points
top_90_DK <- head(team_games[order(team_games$DK, decreasing = T), ], 0.1*nrow(team_games))
top_game_ids <- top_90_DK$game_id

#create summary data frame of player games with only the 90+ pctile of games
top_90_batters <- batter_games[which(batter_games$game_id %in% top_game_ids), ] %>%
  group_by(BatOrder) %>%
  summarise(avgDK = mean(DK), medianDK = median(DK))
top_90_batters <- top_90_batters[-which(top_90_batters$BatOrder == 0), ]
top_90_batters$Pct <- top_90_batters$avgDK/sum(top_90_batters$avgDK)

###*** CONCLUSION: Top Heavy
###*Tier 1: 1 - 3
###*Tier 2: 4
###*Tier 3: 5 - 6
###*Tier 4: 7 - 8
###*Tier 5: 9
###*1 - 6 Stack of a high conviction team is obviously the best
###*However with salary constraints, can use the tiers to help find best stack
